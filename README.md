# wp-elm-course-catalog-widget
A widget that displays a search box that returns matching courses 
that are contained within The PSA Learning system

The Learning Centre has built a temporary bridge between the 
courses that are contained within the Public Service Agency's 
instance of PeopleSoft ELM (PSA Learning System). A manual admin
process produces a JSON Feed at a public URL. This widget embeds
that feed into the widget and provides a javascript interface to 
search through the available courses and access them on the 
PSA Learning System.
